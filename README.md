# Battery-cell-Thermal-Bypass
This is the first library of Battery Operation System
BOS utilizes reconfigurable battery system technology and its libraries.
The selection of the Thermal Bypass library is based on the objective of this study, which is improving thermal degradation. The Thermal Bypass library can be employed in most BESS applications, as temperature balance is one of the main objectives of every BESS system. These systems can benefit from the elongated battery pack system life span. 
The Pybamm library, which is a reference, is required to be installed. (https://github.com/pybamm-team)
